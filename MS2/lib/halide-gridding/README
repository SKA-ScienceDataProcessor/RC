Gridding expressed in Halide
============================

A gridding implementation in Halide.

Files:
  * README - this file.
  * gridding.cpp - a Halide expression of various gridding algorithms. Right now it consists only of SIMPLE algorithm
    It is compiled to executable and that executable produces algorithms to be run.
  * Makefile - default target is to create gridding algorithms implementations. Other targets:
     * ...
  * test.cpp - conformance tests for gridding algorithms. Checks that algorithms do what they should.
  * performance.cpp - performance tests (TBD).


Noticeable Halide quirks
========================

  * Halide supports images with dimensions up to 4 (x,y,z,w). You have to reduce dimensionality of
    arrays to 4. For example, visibilities array has dimensionality of 4, while in Romein code it is
    5-dimensional.
