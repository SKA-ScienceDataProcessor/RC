This is a standalone library which provides a low level API for reading OSKAR
binary format files. This version of the library is specifically targeted for
OSKAR binary format version 2 which is used by versions of oskar >= 2.6.0.

Two tests are provided as examples of how to use the API.

- Test_binary.c (which builds to the the executable binary_test), demonstrates
  very general low level use of the library.
- Test_binary_vis_read_write.c (which build to the executable
  test_binary_vis_read_write) demonstrates how to read and write the
  visibility block format of oskar 2.6.0 visibility binary files.

The motivation for providing this low level API is that while the arrangement
of data blocks within the OSKAR binary formats generated by OSKAR simulator
applications will likely change from time to time, it is envisaged that the
binary format used to store these data files will be updated far less frequently.
