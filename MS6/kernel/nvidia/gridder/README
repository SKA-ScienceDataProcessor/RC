This is an adaptation of GPU gridder form NVidia: https://github.com/SKA-ScienceDataProcessor/GPUGrid.

Only gather gridder variant is extracted.

API is adapted to be usable on real-world data. Essentially right now only 5-tuples variant can be used out of the box (separate uvw-triples and complex amplitudes won't work because we shouldn't sort uvw triples separately).

Sort utility is improved (sorter is inlined) and factored out of the test code, thus we have isolated library API, usable from any clent code.
