To make this functions available to Halide-generated GPU kernels, please, rebuild Halide from the sources against modified device libraries supplied by NVidia and distributed with Halide sources (they normally reside under Halide's src/runtime/nvidia_libdevice_bitcode).

You should compile 'datomic-fixed.ll' with NVPTX-enabled LLVM, link resulting bitcode into NVidia device libraries and rebuild Halide from the sources after that.

(We don't use 'datomicx-fixed.ll' in our code ATM and placed it here because we may need it in the future.)
