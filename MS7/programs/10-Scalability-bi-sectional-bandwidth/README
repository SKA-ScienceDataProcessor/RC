Scalability and bi-sectional bandwidth
======================================

Requirements
------------

The program shall start an actor on each core on a subset of the cluster for a total of at least 15,000 cores.  A communication scheme among the actors will transfer data which should approximate the bi-sectional bandwidth of the cluster with actors.

Implementation
--------------

TODO: Either coloring or Active Messaging.
