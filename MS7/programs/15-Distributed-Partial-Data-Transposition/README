Distributed Partial Data Transposition
======================================

Requirements
------------

A first actor creates a Region with a two dimensional index space, naturally ordered row-wise (i.e. subsequent elements rows are contiguous in memory, different rows become contiguous memory segments).  A set of $k$ second actors performs work on $k$ sets of columns of the region.  The data is transfered to the second actors in such a manner that it is contiguous.
