Foreign function interfaces: C++/OpenMP, and MPI programs execute inside Actors
===============================================================================


Requirements
------------

An actor in a data flow program shall be able to call C++ functions, parallelized with OpenMP and can leverage MPI programs.

Implementation
--------------

TODO

Notes
-----

This is actually three different programs, which have to be built separately (OpenMP is not required for C++).
