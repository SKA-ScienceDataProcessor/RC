Algorithmic Expressiveness
==========================

Requirements
------------

A data flow program will perform a data dependent decision, invoke different actors in the branches of the decision and exit.   Another data flow program will approximate a square root using Newton's algorithm and exit when the square of the result is sufficiently small.

Implementation
--------------

(pretty straighforward)
