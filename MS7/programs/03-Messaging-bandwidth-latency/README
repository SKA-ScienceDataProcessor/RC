Messaging - bandwidth and latency
=================================

Requirements
------------

The data flow system shall use a high performance interconnect between processes.  A latency and bandwidth study will demonstrate the utilization of the link.

 # The data flow system will spawn two processes that communicate in a client server fashion.  
 # The client will send buffers of $K$ bytes each at least 3 times, where $K=1...2^32$.  
 # When the buffer has been received, the server process will send a response to the client, upon which the client will send the next buffer.
 # The program will print out bandwidth and latency of the communication process.

Implementation
--------------

How we map requirements to implementation:

 # We should use coloring to distinguish between processes.
 #
