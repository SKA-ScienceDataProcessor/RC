Resource Management
===================

Requirements
------------

The data flow system shall handle resource management in its scheduling.

 # A program will start 4 actors, two senders running on separate nodes, and two receivers running on a single node.
 # Each processes will be allowed to use $K$ bytes of memory.
 # Each sender will send $K$ bytes to each receiver, which acknowledges receipt and exits.
 # The program will demonstrate that if $K$ is more than $\frac{1}{2}$ of available RAM on the receiving node, the two receiving actors will be scheduled sequentially (to avoid deadlock). \item When $K$ is less than $\frac{1}{2}$ available RAM on the receiver, the two receiving actors will be scheduled concurrently.

Implementation
--------------

Have to see whether it is possible to use GASnet active messaging from Legion.
