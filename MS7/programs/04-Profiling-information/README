Profiling information
=====================

Requirements
------------

Event and debug logs shall be handled as follows.  Under ~/.df-logs the data flow system will create multiple directories. Filenames surrounded by square brackets will be substituted by values:

 # slurm/[jobid]/ - global parameters and output of the job here - like the nodes on which it is running
 # slurm/[jobid]/[network nodeid]/ - log files here
 # slurm/[jobid]/[task rank] - a symbolic link to the corresponding network-nodeid directory 
 # local/pid’s/ - global parameters and output of the job here
 # local/pid’s/nodeid’s/logs
 # names/symbolic-links contain a string with [time-job-name-job params] and point to slurm jobid or process id directories

In this milestone we can rely on a shared file system to unify this into a global directory of log / debug / profiling information for the job.

The log files will leverage CPU performance counters, and a similar set of data for GPU.

The debug target and level can be amended dynamically.

Implementation
--------------

Legion system has profiling and logging, we'll exploit that.
