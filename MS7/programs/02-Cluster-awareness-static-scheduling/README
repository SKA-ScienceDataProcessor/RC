Cluster awareness and static scheduling
=======================================

Requirements
------------

The data flow system shall make the programs aware of the cluster architecture.  A sample data flow program will

 # Find the nodes in the cluster
 # Define a tree structure
 # Have a coordinator run at level 0
 # Start processes on level 1
 # The level 1 processes start island groups of other processes at level 2
 # The processes at level 2 can have $1...N$ cores per process, and $K$ GB of RAM per process. 
 # The cluster architecture and process tree with its resources is printed out

Implementation
--------------

Finding nodes on cluster is implicit in Legion runtime.

The coordination can be done through coloring - we partition data on different nodes using "colors" (node indices).
