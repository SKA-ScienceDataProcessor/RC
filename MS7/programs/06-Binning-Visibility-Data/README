Binning irregular Visibility Data
=================================

Requirements
------------

A data flow program that reads visibility data from file in OSKAR binary file format, estimates computation complexity for tiles and produces HDF5 file. The HDF5 file should contain two-dimensional array with groups as elements, each group provide visibilities relevant to tile.


Implementation
--------------
